# Data files

## Tests

The files `test-*` are used for testing the parser(s). `test-cases` are short cases that cover different facets of
parsing fish detail texts, a sort of unit-tests. `test-samples-parsed` are real-world examples that are parsed
correctly, while `test-samples-with-issues` are known to have issues with the strict parser.
